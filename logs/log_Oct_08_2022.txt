These spellcasters have a rudimentary method in place that can grant such power to any animal companion, infusing them with elemental power and granting them otherworldly insight. Xerbystes will sometimes gift these companions as a favor to others or have his spellcasters infuse the companions of trusted allies. If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have a savage or nimble animal companion, you can instead choose to for it to become a genie-touched companion. When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion. The genies and their elemental traits are as follows: djinni (air), efreeti (fire), marid (water), or shaitan (earth). A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie's elemental trait.".

Construct companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you do, with one difference: the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to Speed. <i>Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32</i>A construct companion has the construct trait. It's not a living creature, nor is it undead. <i>Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32</i>Your construct companion is trained in its unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, all saving throws, Perception, Acrobatics, and Athletics.

First, most effects that end the dying condition don't work to save a construct companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill instead of Medicine.

A companion has the same level you do. As you gain levels, you might make further adjustments as your companion grows more powerful. Construct companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you do, with one difference: the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to Speed. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32A construct companion has the construct trait. It's not a living creature, nor is it undead. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32Your construct companion is trained in its unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, all saving throws, Perception, Acrobatics, and Athletics. Construct companions can't use abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have an ability that allows it. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32Your construct companion is either Small or Medium, chosen by you when you first gain the companion. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32Your construct companion has two kinds of melee unarmed attacks. Its first unarmed attack deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. Depending on the shape of your construct this could be a fist, tendril, or other similar unarmed attack. Its other unarmed attack deals 1d6 slashing or piercing damage (choose when you first gain the companion) and has the agile and finesse traits. Depending on the shape of your construct, this could be a spine or spike, jaws or fangs, a retractable blade, or other similar unarmed attack. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32A construct companion begins with base ability modifiers of Str +3, Dex +3, Con +2, Int –4, Wis +1, Cha +0. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 32Your construct companion has 10 Hit Points, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution modifier for each level you have. While constructs are usually immediately destroyed at 0 Hit Points, your construct companion is a little harder to destroy than other constructs are. When your construct reaches 0 Hit Points, it becomes broken and begins sparking and might be destroyed if you don't Repair it. This works the same as the normal dying rules and determines if your construct is destroyed, with the following two changes. First, most effects that end the dying condition don't work to save a construct companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill instead of Medicine. Second, instead of gaining and tracking the wounded condition, if your construct becomes broken in this way more than twice within a 10-minute period, it's destroyed, and you'll need to reconstruct it by spending a day of downtime. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 33Because it's a construct, your construct companion is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious. Because the construct isn't a living creature, effects that heal living creatures can't help it recover Hit Points. Restoring Hit Points to it requires using the Repair action or other means that can restore Hit Points to objects and nonliving creatures. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 33Your construct companion has precise vision, imprecise hearing, and vague touch senses, but no sense of smell or taste. Guns &amp; Gears pg. 33Your construct companion has a Speed of 25 feet.".
