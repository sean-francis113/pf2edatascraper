Your eidolon's appearance and physical form vary based on your shared vision for its construction, from clockworks to stuffed dolls and everything between, and it's not uncommon for that appearance to change greatly as your construct gains evolutions. Because it arises from an astral entity, your construct is no mindless servitor, but a fully thinking being with its own ideas, goals, and even emotions. These entities are extremely diverse; while many construct eidolons come from a powerful symbiotic connection with astral denizens, just as many arise from the forgotten memories of ancient empires and craftworks drifting across the Silver Sea of the Astral Plane.".

You and your psychopomp eidolon share an important fate together, whether it relates directly to your own soul or to a mission that will somehow protect the souls of others.

[15:57:54]: Organizing Eidolon Data (Without Forms).
[15:57:54]: Added "Angel","https://2e.aonprd.com/Eidolons.aspx?ID=1","Your eidolon is a celestial messenger, a member of the angelic host with a unique link to you, allowing them to carry a special message to the mortal world at your side. Most angel eidolons are roughly humanoid in form, with feathered wings, glowing eyes, halos, or similar angelic features. However, some take the form of smaller angelic servitors like the winged helmet cassisian angel instead. The two of you are destined for an important role in the plans of the celestial realms. Though a true angel, your angel eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the angelic messenger ritual, even if they somehow learn it.","Divine","Medium or Small","Diplomacy,Religion","darkvision","Celestial","25 feet","Hallowed Strikes","Your eidolon's attacks are hallowed by the celestial realms. Your eidolon's unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1 good damage; as usual, this extra damage harms only evil creatures or those with a weakness to good damage. Additionally, your eidolon can make nonlethal attacks with its unarmed attacks without taking the usual –2 circumstance penalty.","Traveler's Aura","Your eidolon emanates a powerful aura—resembling that of an astral deva—that protects creatures as they travel. The aura has the abjuration, aura, and divine traits. Your eidolon and its allies within a 20-foot emanation are protected from severe heat and cold, and your eidolon is never flat-footed to creatures inside the aura that are of a lower level than the eidolon. When you gain the transcendence class feature, this evolves to the full benefits of an astral deva; your eidolon and allies in the aura are protected from environmental damage from any plane, including severe and extreme heat and cold as well as more unusual dangers.","Angelic Mercy","Your eidolon's angelic power allows them to assuage a variety of ailments, just like most other powerful angels. Your eidolon can cast remove curse, remove disease, remove fear, and remove paralysis once per day each as 9th-level divine innate spells." to Organized List.
[15:57:54]: Added "Anger Phantom","https://2e.aonprd.com/Eidolons.aspx?ID=2","Your eidolon is a lost soul, bound to the mortal world by undying anger or a bitter grudge. Most phantom eidolons are humanoids with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms. Your link with your eidolon prevents it from succumbing to corruption and undeath. Together, you will need to decide whether to work with your eidolon to control its anger, or channel its wrath into power.","Occult","Medium or Small","Intimidation,Occultism","darkvision","one common mortal language the eidolon spoke in life","25 feet","Furious Strike","Your eidolon can infuse an attack with unmitigated rage. It gains the Furious Strike activity.","Seething Frenzy","Your eidolon can stoke itself into a frenzy. It gains the Seething Frenzy action.","Anger Aura","Your eidolon exudes wrath in an aura around it, rousing the ire of nearby creatures and causing their defenses to crack as they seethe with rage. Your eidolon gains a 20-foot anger aura, which has the aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, and occult traits. The resistances of any creature in the aura, including you, your allies, your enemies, and your eidolon, are reduced by an amount equal to 3 + your eidolon's Constitution modifier. Your eidolon can hold in its rage by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This reduces the aura's effect to affect only your eidolon. It can take this action again to reinstate the full effect of its aura. Creatures in a barbarian Rage, Seething Frenzy, or similar ability that allows them to channel their anger aren't affected by the anger aura." to Organized List.
[15:57:54]: Added "Beast","https://2e.aonprd.com/Eidolons.aspx?ID=3","Your eidolon is a manifestation of the life force of nature in the form of a powerful magical beast that often has animal features, possibly even several from different species. You might have learned the way to connect with the world's life force via a specific philosophy or practice, such as the beliefs of the god callers of Sarkoris, or formed a bond on your own. Regardless, your link to your eidolon allows you both to grow in power and influence to keep your home safe from those who would despoil it.","Primal","Medium","Intimidation,Nature","low-light vision","Sylvan","25 feet","Beast's Charge","Your eidolon can make a ferocious charge or pounce on foes, allowing it to quickly engage. It gains the Beast's Charge activity.","Primal Roar","Your eidolon can bellow a terrifying roar, screech, croak, or other overpowering sound to frighten foes. It gains the Primal Roar activity.","Whirlwind Maul","Your eidolon thrashes violently, damaging many foes in its reach. It gains the Whirlwind Maul activity." to Organized List.
[15:57:54]: Added "Construct","https://2e.aonprd.com/Eidolons.aspx?ID=4","Your eidolon is a mental construct based on an astral thoughtform and given physical presence and life by its connection to you, its shape limited only by your imagination. Your eidolon's appearance and physical form vary based on your shared vision for its construction, from clockworks to stuffed dolls and everything between, and it's not uncommon for that appearance to change greatly as your construct gains evolutions. Because it arises from an astral entity, your construct is no mindless servitor, but a fully thinking being with its own ideas, goals, and even emotions. These entities are extremely diverse; while many construct eidolons come from a powerful symbiotic connection with astral denizens, just as many arise from the forgotten memories of ancient empires and craftworks drifting across the Silver Sea of the Astral Plane.","Arcane","Medium","Arcana,Crafting","darkvision","one common mortal language","25 feet","Construct Heart","Your construct eidolon has a link directly to your life force, which renders it a living creature and therefore susceptible to many ailments that bother only the living, though it does possess some resistances to these effects. It doesn't have a construct's normal immunities,  but does gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, necromancy, and poison effects, as well as effects causing the fatigued or sickened conditions. Additionally, its astral essence bleeds off slowly, and it only needs to succeed at a DC 10 flat check to remove persistent bleed damage (or DC 5 after receiving particularly effective aid).","Reconfigured Evolution","Your construct eidolon is particularly easy to reconfigure, gaining an additional evolution that suits both of your whims. Choose one additional evolution feat of 6th level or lower. Your eidolon gains that feat. You can Retrain this feat for any other evolution feat of 6th level or lower with only a single day of downtime if you succeed at a Crafting check, with a standard DC of your eidolon's level. If you fail, you can try again on a later day. Many summoners choose Eidolon's Wrath for this ability.","Ultimate Reconfiguration","Your construct eidolon becomes even more customizable. Choose an evolution feat of 16th level or lower. Your eidolon gains that feat. You can spend downtime to adjust it using Crafting, just like the feat from reconfigured evolution.

While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the abyssal pact ritual, even if they somehow learn it.","Divine","Medium or Small","Intimidation,Religion","darkvision","Abyssal","25 feet","Embodiments of Sin","While all demon eidolons have an associated sin, those sins can be incredibly varied. While many demon summoners conjure up easily recognizable eidolons, such as tempter demons appearing in the form of seductive succubi or wrecker demons taking on the form of destructive abrikandilus, other demons may also answer the call, including ones no one has ever seen before on the Material Plane. A greed-filled summoner might find that their eidolon is in truth one of the fearsome boar demons known as a nalfeshnee, while a summoner whose secret sins are stranger and darker than the average person might ever contemplate could conjure up a demonic presence whose appearance has never been recorded in the history of the mortal world.</div></div> Demon","Demonic Strikes","Your eidolon's attacks are corrupted by the Abyss and imbued with pure evil and shifting chaos. All your eidolon's unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1 evil damage; as usual, this extra damage harms only good creatures or those with a weakness to evil damage. Additionally, choose one of your eidolon's unarmed attacks that deals physical damage; it gains the versatile trait for a different type of physical damage you choose.","Visions of Sin","Your demon is born of sin and can project the sin it is formed from into the minds of others.

Your link with your eidolon prevents them from succumbing to corruption and undeath, and together, you will grow in strength and fulfill your phantom's devotion.","Occult","Medium or Small","Medicine,Occultism","darkvision","one common mortal language the eidolon spoke in life","25 feet","Dutiful Retaliation","Your eidolon deeply respects your assistance, and it extends its loyalty to you, attacking those who dare harm you. It gains the Dutiful Retaliation reaction.","Steadfast Devotion","Your eidolon's dedication makes it extremely challenging for your foes to bend its mind. Your eidolon gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against mental effects, and if they roll a success against such an effect, they get a critical success instead. If you have the shared resolve class feature and your eidolon rolls a critical failure against a mental effect, they get a failure instead.","Devotion Aura","After fighting at your side for so long, your eidolon has become as devoted to protecting you and your allies as it is to its original cause. It gains a 20-foot devotion aura, which has the abjuration, aura, and occult traits. Whenever one of your eidolon's allies within the aura takes damage, you can reduce the damage by your eidolon's Constitution modifier. You lose a number of Hit Points equal to half the amount by which the eidolon reduced the damage, rounded down. If the damage was lower than the Constitution modifier, base the damage you take on the actual amount of  damage prevented." to Organized List.

Such an entity is extremely powerful but unable to interact with the outside world on its own. Dragon eidolons manifest in the powerful, scaled forms they had in life; most take the form of true dragons (albeit smaller), but some manifest as drakes or other draconic beings. You have forged a connection with such a dragon eidolon and together, you seek to grow as powerful as an ancient wyrm.","Arcane","Medium","Arcana,Intimidation","darkvision","Draconic","25 feet","Breath Weapon","Your eidolon has a powerful breath weapon, which they are able to use regularly to wreak havoc upon your foes. They gain the Breath Weapon activity. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, or poison, and choose whether the area is a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. Unless you chose piercing damage, both Breath Weapon and your eidolon gain the trait matching the damage type.","Draconic Frenzy","Your eidolon can make a furious assault, potentially recovering the use of their Breath Weapon. They gain the Draconic Frenzy activity.","Wyrm's Breath","Your eidolon can draw upon the power of wyrms to enhance the eidolon's Breath Weapon.

Many fey appear similar to mortal humanoids with unusual features such as pointed ears, wings, or bodies composed of natural elements, but the full variety of fey is endless, and many others appear completely inhuman. Fey from the First World never truly die, instead forming a new creature. Fey eidolons usually come about when a summoner helps stabilize a difficult reformation. This means your fey eidolon likely lived a different life just before meeting you and might remember fragments of its old memories. Together, you might have to unravel a memory from your eidolon's past life among the fey.","Primal","Small or Medium","Deception,Nature","low-light vision","Sylvan","25 feet","Fey Gift Spells","Your eidolon expands your primal magic with enchantment and illusion magic, allowing both of you to wield the power of fey charm and glamour. When you add spells to your repertoire, you can choose from the primal list as well as from enchantment and illusion spells that appear on the arcane spell list. As usual for when you add spells of a different tradition to your spell list, you're still a primal spellcaster, so all of your spells are primal spells. Your eidolon gains the Magical Understudy summoner feat, despite not meeting the prerequisite level, and it can choose fey gift cantrips in addition to primal cantrips. As usual for a feat you are granted by name, you can't retrain Magical Understudy into another feat.","Fey Mischief","Your eidolon's fey magic becomes more powerful and mischievous. Your eidolon gains the Magical Adept feat, despite not meeting the prerequisite level, and can choose from fey gift spells in addition to primal spells.","Fey Chicanery","Ever full of tricks, your fey eidolon twists magical protections into your shared life force, granting it a contingency in its back pocket for desperate situations. During your daily preparations, your eidolon can cast a contingency spell. The 4th-level spell it chooses must come from the primal or fey gift list, and must either be common or be another spell you have access to." to Organized List.

Plant eidolons tend to be curious and adaptable, with temperaments based on the parts of mortal culture they feel affinity toward. Despite coming from the same source, plant eidolons don't always look like leshys. Plant eidolons have forms that vary greatly and can look like almost any kind of plant creature in existence. Some even resemble plant creatures so strange they are impossible to identify.","Primal","Medium","Nature,Survival","low-light vision","Sylvan","25 feet","Tendril Strike","Your eidolon can stretch out vines and roots, attacking foes outside its reach. It gains the Tendril Strike action.","Growing Vines","Your eidolon's vines and branches lengthen even more.

Psychopomp eidolons have a variety of appearances, but since they often traffic with mortals, their form typically includes an elaborate mask. You and your psychopomp eidolon share an important fate together, whether it relates directly to your own soul or to a mission that will somehow protect the souls of others.","Divine","Medium","Intimidation,Religion","darkvision","Requian","25 feet","Spirit Touch","Your eidolon's attacks possess a psychopomp's ability to harm the living and the dead. Your eidolon's unarmed Strikes affect incorporeal creatures as though etched with a ghost touch property rune and deal an extra 1 negative damage to living creatures and an extra 1 positive damage to undead.","Hidden Watcher","Your eidolon can render both of you unseen. Once per hour, it can cast invisibility targeting you, them, or both of you at once. If the spell targeted both of you, the spell ends for both of you if either of you uses a hostile action.","Spirit Taker","Your eidolon is particularly capable when it comes to handling bodiless spirits and putting undead to their final rest. Your eidolon can see incorporeal creatures inside of solid objects and can attack them with Strikes without penalty; an incorporeal creature in a solid object that takes damage from your eidolon's Strike is expelled from the object to the nearest available space, moving closer to your eidolon if possible. Additionally, your eidolon can target or affect a creature projecting its consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing another creature, even if its body is elsewhere, though your eidolon must know about the possession or projection and choose to do so. Finally, the spirit of an undead destroyed by your eidolon's Strikes is sent directly to the Boneyard for judgment; an undead with an ability to avoid such a fate automatically, such as a ghost's rejuvenation, can attempt a counteract check against your spell DC to return via that ability as normal. In that case, it uses its Will save modifier as its counteract modifier." to Organized List.

Undead eidolons take about every imaginable shape and form, as their bodies manifest from their connection to you. Their ultimate form can be influenced by an amalgamation of the echoes and memories of their old life before becoming undead, their cause of death, their encounters in the afterlife, and portions of your own essences. Together, you and your eidolon need to explore the mysteries of life, death, and undeath to understand what your bond means for both of your futures.","Divine","Medium or Small","Intimidation,Religion","darkvision","Necril","25 feet","Negative Essence","Your undead eidolon has a link directly to your life force, which grants it a twilight state between living and undead. This renders it a living creature and therefore susceptible to many ailments that bother only the living, though it does possess some resistances to these effects. The eidolon has negative healing, meaning it heals from negative energy effects that heal undead and is damaged by positive energy effects that damage undead. It doesn't have an undead's normal immunities, but it does gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, and poison effects, and non-damaging effects that target only undead. Additionally, its necrotic essence stanches its wounds easily. The flat check to remove persistent bleed damage from the eidolon is DC 10 (or DC 5 after receiving particularly effective aid).","Drain Life","Your eidolon's link with you sustains it, but it still craves the life essence of the living, whether through blood or pure essence. It gains the Drain Life activity.Activate","Rejuvenation","Your eidolon's unusual connection with you allows you both to rejuvenate when defeated. The first time each day your turn begins while you're dying, you instantly regain a number of Hit Points equal to three times your level and wake up. (Increase your wounded condition as normal.) You can immediately Manifest your Eidolon as a free action. You can then take your turn as normal." to Organized List.
